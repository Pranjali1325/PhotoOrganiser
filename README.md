Task 1:
 Read the images from a folder. Print out the names of the files read. Try reading one of the images using Opencv.
 By applying supervised learning, we train a model with the labeled data, then we apply the model to predict the unlabeled data. It would be hard to convince ourselves that the model would be general enough, after all we learned from only the minority of data set. A better strategy could be to first cluster the images into groups (unsupervised learning), and then apply the supervised learning algorithm on each of the groups individually. The unsupervised learning in the first stage could help us to narrow down the scope of learning so that the supervised learning in the second stage could obtain better accuracy.
